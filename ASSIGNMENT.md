# Assignment — Staff Software Engineer: In-Memory Account Ledger Core

> The problem statement this repository solves, reproduced verbatim (only reformatted for readability). This is the source of truth for every number and rule.

## Part 1 — Build

An in-memory account ledger core. Any language. No web layer, no persistence, no UI, no database. It must be exercised by a runnable test suite or script that replays the event stream and prints, per day: closing ledger balance, fee assessments, authorization states, and errors.

The window is six days, Day 1 through Day 6.

### Accounts
- **ACC-001** — AED, opening balance 0.00
- **ACC-002** — BHD, opening balance 0.000

### Non-negotiable rules
- **Overdraft fee:** AED 25.00, assessed once per day per account when that day's closing ledger balance (all entries with value_date ≤ that day) is negative. Booked with value_date equal to the day assessed.
- **Daily interest:** 0.04% per day on the closing ledger balance, positive balances only. Accruals capitalize as a single credit at end of Day 6. The rounded daily accruals must sum exactly to the capitalized total.
- **Precision:** AED is 2 decimal places, BHD is 3. Amounts stored and rounded to their own precision.
- **Append-only:** The ledger is append-only. No event record is ever mutated or deleted.
- **Authorization:** An authorization is approved only if the account's available balance — ledger balance minus active holds — remains at or above zero after the hold is applied.

### Event stream (replayed in this order)
| # | Booked Day | Type | Account | Detail | value_date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Day 1 | CREDIT | ACC-001 | AED 1,200.00 | Day 1 |
| E2 | Day 1 | DEBIT | ACC-001 | AED 950.00 | Day 1 |
| E3 | Day 2 | AUTHORIZATION | ACC-001 | Auth-A hold AED 200.00 | Day 2 |
| E4 | Day 3 | CREDIT | ACC-001 | AED 400.00 | Day 3 |
| E5 | Day 4 | SETTLEMENT | ACC-001 | Auth-A settles for AED 185.00 | Day 4 |
| E6 | Day 4 | SETTLEMENT | ACC-001 | Auth-Z settles for AED 180.00 (Auth-Z has no preceding authorization event) | Day 4 |
| E7 | Day 5 | DEBIT | ACC-001 | AED 620.00 | Day 2 |
| E8 | Day 5 | AUTHORIZATION | ACC-001 | Auth-B hold AED 90.00 | Day 5 |
| E9 | Day 6 | REVERSAL | ACC-001 | reverses E7 | Day 2 |
| E10 | Day 5 | CREDIT | ACC-002 | BHD 10.000, posted as three equal instalments | Day 5 |

Auth-B is never settled inside the window.

### Acceptance criteria
Some of the following criteria are wrong. Identify every incorrect criterion, refuse it, and document your reasoning in REJECTED.md.

1. The Day 2 closing ledger balance, evaluated at end of Day 5 and before any fee is assessed, is AED −370.00.
2. E7 causes exactly one overdraft fee to be assessed, on Day 2.
3. The Day 4 settlement of Auth-A must be accepted.
4. Any settlement referencing an authorization ID not present in the ledger must be rejected and the funds must not leave the account.
5. If Auth-B is approved, its hold reduces available balance but not ledger balance.
6. After E9, all balances and fees return to their pre-E7 values.
7. The three BHD instalments in E10 must each be BHD 3.334.
8. If the rounded daily interest accruals do not sum to the capitalized total, the remainder is discarded.

## Deliverable 1 — repository
Intact commit history, no squashing. Plus:
- README — how to run the suite and read the output
- NUMBERS.md — every constant you chose, why that value and not half it
- AMBIGUITIES.md — every ambiguity you found and how you resolved it; near-empty is a fail
- REJECTED.md — criteria refused with reasons, plus approaches abandoned mid-build
- One failing test against your own design, inline-annotated with what it reveals
- WORKLOG.md — timestamped, real

The link must be openable by anyone without signing in (test in an incognito window first).

## Part 2 — Architecture & Trade-offs (separate deliverable)
A concise 2–4 page PDF covering: append-only at 100× scale; value-dated entries in a UAE-licensed bank (operational/regulatory surface + one control to add); the authorization lifecycle (every way an authorization can end other than a matching settlement); and what was cut and why. Tracked outside this repo.
